# RGB JHewitt Wardriver

### This is still in testing... Use at your own risk

Enhanced Rev3 Wardriver with RGB LEDs: A modified version of Hewitt's wardriver, now with added functionality.

## Enhanced Wardriver with RGB LEDs

This project is a modified version of the open-source JHewitt wardriver, originally developed by Joseph Hewitt. 
This project adds reactive LED illumination while wardriving. The device flashes green for wifi signals found and blue for bluetooth signals found.
The motivation behind this modification was to add RGB LEDs to the wardriver, inspired by the aesthetics of a resin-printed Krrawn case, which prompted the desire for illuminated features.

## Features

- Addition of RGB LEDs
- Custom code to control the LEDs
- Integration of a button for toggling LED mode (on/off)

## Installation

To install the enhanced wardriver with RGB LEDs, follow these steps:

1. Solder the button and LEDs according to the provided instructions.
2. Install the provided code onto the device.
3. For an installation guide of the mod, visit [www.forresttindall.com](http://www.forresttindall.com). 
Also see [463n7s video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snlNfVZJ6Xw&t=24s) for a full video guide.
4. Also see original repository from [Jhewitt here.](https://github.com/JosephHewitt/wardriver_rev3)

## Usage

The RGB LEDs are controlled by a single button located on the front panel. To interact with the LEDs, follow these instructions:

- Press and hold the button for approximately 3-4 seconds to turn on and off the reactive lighting mode.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Joseph Hewitt ([@JosephHewitt](https://github.com/JosephHewitt)) for the original wardriver code, engineering and inspiration. Additionally, acknowledgment goes to [Krrawn](https://www.instagram.com/krrawn/?hl=en) for his case design, which sparked the idea to integrate RGB LEDs into the wardriver.

Also a special thanks to my wife Elle Caton, for crucial improvements to button functionality UX via the implimentation of an immediate off function.
