# RGB JHewitt Wardriver
Enhanced Rev3 Wardriver with RGB LEDs: A modified version of Hewitt's wardriver, now with added functionality.

## Enhanced Wardriver with RGB LEDs

This project is a modified version of the open-source JHewitt wardriver, originally developed by Joseph Hewitt. The motivation behind this modification was to add RGB LEDs to the wardriver, inspired by the aesthetics of a resin-printed Krrawn case, which prompted the desire for illuminated features.

## Features

- Addition of RGB LEDs
- Custom code to control the LEDs
- Integration of a button for toggling LED modes (on/off and color selection)

## Installation

To install the enhanced wardriver with RGB LEDs, follow these steps:

1. Solder the button and LEDs according to the provided instructions.
2. Install the provided code onto the device.
3. For an installation guide of the mod, visit [www.forresttindall.com](http://www.forresttindall.com). 
Also see [463n7s video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snlNfVZJ6Xw&t=24s) for a full video guide.

## Usage

The RGB LEDs are controlled by a single button located on the front panel. To interact with the LEDs, follow these instructions:

- Press and hold the button for approximately 3-4 seconds to toggle between LED modes.
- There are a total of 7 color modes to choose from, along with an option to turn the LEDs off.

## Customization

Users can customize the behavior and appearance of the RGB LEDs by modifying the provided code. Additional features and functionalities can be added based on individual preferences and requirements.
